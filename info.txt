the react app is created under client direcoty using the command
npx create-react-app client

the other projects (server, worker) are manually created and typed.

creating Dockerfile.dev in each project for dev 
 this will make it easier to update code and test without having to rebuild containers each time
 remember we need to map the volume

Also docker-compose.yml is created to bring the dependecies such as postgres and redis
  for dev purposes

Remember: docker-compose up (to build and run)
